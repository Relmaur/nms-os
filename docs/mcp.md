# ATLAS for AI assistants (MCP)

ATLAS ships a small **MCP server**, published on npm as [`nms-atlas-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nms-atlas-mcp) (source: `apps/mcp`): an AI assistant that speaks the Model Context Protocol (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and others) can use it to answer questions about No Man's Sky from ATLAS's verified wiki mirror, and about **your own log**: your systems, outlaw stations, ships, notes and timers. Decision and privacy notes: ADR-0008.

It runs on your computer, only reads, and never changes your log.

## Set up
The package's page (`apps/mcp/README.md`) has the short version: add `npx -y nms-atlas-mcp` to your client, with Node 20 or newer. It downloads the wiki data from ATLAS's site on first run (about 10 MB, kept in your cache folder and checked for updates once a day). The steps below run it from a clone of the repo instead, which uses the repo's own mirror.

1. Clone the repo, then `pnpm install` and `pnpm index:wiki` (Node 24 or newer). After a `git pull` that brings new wiki pages, run `pnpm index:wiki` again: the files the server reads are derived, not committed.
2. Choose how it reads your log:
   - **Sync code (recommended):** in the app, More → Sync → Show the code, then copy it. The server fetches your encrypted copy and opens it on your computer, just as a paired device does.
   - **Exported file:** More → Your data → Export, and point `ATLAS_STATE_FILE` at the file. Nothing is fetched, but answers only change when you export again.
   - **Neither:** the game tools still work; the tools about your log say how to connect one.
3. Add it to your client. For Claude Desktop, in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "atlas": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/nms-os/apps/mcp/src/main.ts"],
         "env": { "ATLAS_SYNC_CODE": "your sync code" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Use the **full path to Node 24** as the command if you use nvm or have an older Node installed too: desktop apps start with the system's path, where `node` may be an older version that can't run the server. In a terminal where `node --version` says v24, `which node` prints the path.

   For Claude Code: `claude mcp add atlas -e ATLAS_SYNC_CODE=… -- node /path/to/nms-os/apps/mcp/src/main.ts`.
4. Restart the client and ask, for example: "Which of my outlaw stations are ready?", "What do I need to craft 3 Warp Cells?", "Does my Multi-Tool's layout match the wiki's rules?"

## Before you paste the code
- **The code is the key to your whole log.** Anything holding it can read and change your log through the sync server, just like a paired device. The MCP server only reads, but the code sits in your client's config file in plain text. If you'd rather not, use an exported file.
- **What you ask about goes to your AI provider.** When the assistant calls a tool about your log, the answer (your systems, notes, ships…) is sent to the model you're using, under that provider's terms. ATLAS sends nothing to any AI on its own.
- To cut it off, turn sync off in the app (the code stops working) or remove the server from your client.

## Tools
| Tool | Answers from |
|---|---|
| `search_codex`, `read_article` | The wiki mirror (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0), with the Codex link, wiki URL and revision |
| `plan_recipe` | The recipe planner's build order: what to gather, then each crafting round |
| `item_value` | Base values from the wiki's infoboxes |
| `best_crafts` | What to craft for money: value gained over the raw materials' own value, at the wiki's base values |
| `cited_facts` | Game rules quoted from the wiki's prose (supercharged slots per class, grid sizes) |
| `list_systems`, `get_system` | Your logged systems, planets, visits and notes |
| `outlaw_status` | Which outlaw stations are ready, when the rest restock, the next run's estimate |
| `list_gear` | Your ships, Multi-Tools and Exosuit, with the wiki's slot rules and any mismatch |
| `search_notes`, `read_note` | Your Markdown notes |
| `list_timers` | Your running and finished timers |

## Settings
| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ATLAS_SYNC_CODE` | Your sync code (or the pairing link). Takes precedence over the file. |
| `ATLAS_STATE_FILE` | Path to an exported `nms_state.json`. |
| `ATLAS_SYNC_URL` | Another relay (https; `http://localhost` for development). Default: ATLAS's own. |
| `ATLAS_WIKI_DIR` | Another wiki folder. Default: the repo's `wiki/` when run from a clone, otherwise the live site's copy, downloaded. |
| `ATLAS_CACHE_DIR` | Where the downloaded copy is kept. Default: the system's cache folder (`nms-atlas-mcp`). |

A synced copy is fetched at most once a minute; changes made in the app show up after the next sync plus that minute.
